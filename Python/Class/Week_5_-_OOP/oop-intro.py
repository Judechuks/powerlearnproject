Object Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm in computer science that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

Building blocks of OOP
Classes - a blueprint of an object
Objects - an instance of a class
Methods - methods represent behaviors
Attributes - information to be stored in a class about an object

Four Principles of OOP
The four pillars of object-oriented programming are:

1. Inheritance: child classes inherit data and behaviors from the parent class
2. Encapsulation: containing information in an object, exposing only selected information
3. Abstraction: only exposing high-level public methods for accessing an object
4. Polymorphism: many methods can do the same task

What are the benefits of OOP?
1. Modularity. 
Encapsulation enables objects to be self-contained, making troubleshooting and collaborative development easier.
2. Reusability. 
Code can be reused through inheritance, meaning a team does not have to write the same code multiple times.
3. Productivity. 
Programmers can construct new programs quickly through the use of multiple libraries and reusable code.

4. Easily upgradable and scalable. 
Programmers can implement system functionalities independently.

5. Interface descriptions.
Descriptions of external systems are simple, due to message-passing techniques that are used for object communication.
6. Security. 
Using encapsulation and abstraction, complex code is hidden, software maintenance is easier and internet protocols are protected.

7. Flexibility. 
Polymorphism enables a single function to adapt to the class it is placed in. Different objects can also pass through the same interface.
